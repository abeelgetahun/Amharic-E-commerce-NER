## About The Project

This repository hosts the primary project for **Amharic E-commerce Named Entity Recognition (NER)**. The core objective of this initiative is to develop a robust system capable of identifying and classifying specific entities within Amharic text data originating from the e-commerce domain. This includes, but is not limited to, recognizing product names, brand names, prices, quantities, locations, and other critical information relevant to online commerce.

The project aims to contribute to the advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Amharic, particularly in the specialized field of e-commerce, where accurately extracting structured information from unstructured text is crucial for various applications like product categorization, recommendation systems, and customer service automation.

## Built With

This project is developed using the following key technologies and tools:

* **Python**: The primary programming language for all scripting, data processing, and model development.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Extensively used for exploratory data analysis, experimentation, model training, and result visualization.
* **Machine Learning/Deep Learning Libraries**: (Presumed, specific libraries would be added here once identified from code, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. It is recommended to use `pip` for package management.

* Python 3.x
* pip

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/abeelgetahun/Amharic-E-commerce-NER.git](https://github.com/abeelgetahun/Amharic-E-commerce-NER.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd Amharic-E-commerce-NER
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies** (Once specific dependencies are identified from `requirements.txt` or setup files, add them here. For now, this is a general command.)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If `requirements.txt` does not exist yet, you may need to install common NLP/ML libraries manually based on the project's development, e.g., `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter`.*

## Usage

(This section will be populated once the project has defined use cases, scripts, or notebooks for running the NER model. For now, it's a placeholder.)

You can explore the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data processing, model training, and evaluation steps. The `scripts/` and `src/` directories contain the core logic and utilities.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* `config/`: Configuration files for the project (e.g., model parameters, data paths).
* `logs/`: Directory for storing execution logs.
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and analysis.
* `scripts/`: Various utility scripts to support the project workflow.
* `src/`: Contains the core source code for the Amharic E-commerce NER system.
* `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
* `README.md`: This README file.
